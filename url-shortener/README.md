### What I Learned

During the development of this project, I had the opportunity to explore and work with various technologies. One significant aspect of my learning journey was integrating **ChatGPT** into my workflow. This AI played a pivotal role as a guide, mentor, and source of knowledge, helping me bridge the gap in my understanding, especially in areas like AI and databases. It empowered me to tackle an intermediate-level project successfully.

I've gained valuable experience in AI and its practical applications, thanks to this project, and I look forward to further improving my skills in this domain.
